IMPLEMENTATION OF KEYPAD INTERFACING:

STEP 1:
   * Find out the free IOs available on your target board pin headers.
   * Decide which are the IO pins are going to use to handle rows and columns of the keypad.
   
STEP 2: 
   * Create requird pointer variables to handle memory-mapped registers.
   * Initialize the pointer variables with appropriate memory-mapped register addresses.
   * Make use of type qualifiers such as 'volatile' if memory-mapped register access is involved.   
   
STEP 3:
    * Initialization
      * Make all row IOs mode as OUTPUT.
      * Make all column IOs mode as INPUT.
      * Active internal pull-up resisters for all column IOs(Refer to the pull-up/pull-down enable registers).
	  
STEP 4:
   * Implement the key detect logic as per the flow chart.
