# **Overview of the Project**

## **Project :  Keypad Interfacing With STM32F407 Discovery-Kit**

### **Objective**
The project aims to interface a 4x4 matrix keypad with the STM32F407 Discovery board.

### **Key Activities**

1. Understanding the Built-in LED:

    - Identify the built-in LED on the Arduino board, typically connected to digital pin 13.

2. Writing the Program:
    - Develop a simple Arduino sketch to control the blinking of the built-in LED.
    - Utilize key functions such as pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and delay() to manage the LED's state and timing.
      
4. Uploading and Executing the Code:
    - Upload the written code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
    - Observe the behavior of the built-in LED as it blinks according to the programmed interval.
      
6. Experimentation and Modification:
    - Experiment by modifying the blinking interval in the code to see how it affects the LED's behavior.
    - Test different delay times and observe the changes in the blinking speed.

7. Troubleshooting:
    - Debug common issues such as incorrect pin configuration or syntax errors in the code.

### **Technologies Used**

1. Arduino Platform:
    - Arduino Board: A microcontroller board with a built-in LED, typically connected to digital pin 13.
    - Arduino IDE: The integrated development environment used to write, compile, and upload code to the Arduino board.
      
2. Programming Languages:
    - C++ : The programming languages used to write the Arduino sketch.

This project provides a foundational understanding of how to control hardware through software, serving as an introductory step
