# **Overview of the Project**

## **Project : LED BLINKING WITH ARDUINO**

### **Objective**

The objective of the LED blinking project with a built-in LED on an Arduino is to provide a simple yet practical introduction to embedded programming and microcontroller usage. By programming the Arduino to blink its built-in LED at a specified interval, the project aims to teach the basics of digital output control, timing, and the foundational concepts of how software interacts with hardware. This serves as an essential starting point for those new to electronics and embedded systems.

### **Key Activities**

1. Understanding the Built-in LED:

    - Identify the built-in LED on the Arduino board, typically connected to digital pin 13.

2. Writing the Program:
    - Develop a simple Arduino sketch to control the blinking of the built-in LED.
    - Utilize key functions such as pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and delay() to manage the LED's state and timing.
      
4. Uploading and Executing the Code:
    - Upload the written code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
    - Observe the behavior of the built-in LED as it blinks according to the programmed interval.
      
6. Experimentation and Modification:
    - Experiment by modifying the blinking interval in the code to see how it affects the LED's behavior.
    - Test different delay times and observe the changes in the blinking speed.

7. Troubleshooting:
    - Debug common issues such as incorrect pin configuration or syntax errors in the code.

### **Technologies Used**

1. Arduino Platform:
    - Arduino Board: A microcontroller board with a built-in LED, typically connected to digital pin 13.
    - Arduino IDE: The integrated development environment used to write, compile, and upload code to the Arduino board.
      
2. Programming Languages:
    - C++ : The programming languages used to write the Arduino sketch.

This project provides a foundational understanding of how to control hardware through software, serving as an introductory step
